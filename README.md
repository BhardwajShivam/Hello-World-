Java is a general purpose, high level programming language designed to produce programs that will run on any computer system.
Java was developed by <b><u>Sun Microsystem</u></b>. A small team of engineers, known as the <b>Green Team</b>, initiated the language in 1991. Java was originally called <b>OAK</b>, and was designed for handheld devices and set-top boxes. Oak was unsuccessful, so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning <b>World Wide Web</b>.
Later, in 2009, <b>Oracle Corporation</b> acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of two key Sun software assets: Java and Solaris.
