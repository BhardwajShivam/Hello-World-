<p>
Java is a general purpose, high level programming language designed to produce programs that will run on any computer system.
Java was developed by <b>Sun Microsystem</b>. A small team of engineers, known as the <b>Green Team</b>, initiated the language in 1991. Java was originally called <b>OAK</b>, and was designed for handheld devices and set-top boxes. Oak was unsuccessful, so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning <b>World Wide Web</b>.
<br>
Later, in 2009, <b>Oracle Corporation</b> acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of two key Sun software assets: Java and Solaris.

<p>
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
